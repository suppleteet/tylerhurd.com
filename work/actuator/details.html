<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  Actuator is a tool I've been working on that leverages real-time physics and tracked VR devices for rigging,
  animating and puppeteering to give you fast and convincing results.
  <br /><br />
  Over the course of my last 2 projects I've been incorporating real-time physics for puppeteering and animation
  and the results are excellent. In VR you're trying to convince the viewer of an object's weight and movement, and
  a real-time physics simulation will give you far more convincing results than hand-keyed animation alone. Not
  only that it gives you the ability to collide and interact with otherwise static lifeless characters. I believe
  this technique of harnessing real-time physics using 6DOF devices is where motion authoring is headed, and
  during development I noticed there aren't any tools to aid in this process, that's where the idea for Actuator
  came from.
  <br /><br />
  The goal of Actuator is to leverage real-time physics and tracked devices into the entire character performance
  pipeline. Start with a 3D model, rig it by drawing physics primitives, and then set up a physically based puppet
  or create animation curves using the real-time physics as the secondary/follow-through.
