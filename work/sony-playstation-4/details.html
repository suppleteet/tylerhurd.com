<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Mill teamed up with Director Rupert Sanders and BBH on the Agency’s first spot for PlayStation. PlayStation “Greatness Awaits” follows ‘the hero’ as he walks down the street and turns the corner into a world that is all things PlayStation. It features as many PlayStation games as possible, making it all about the gamers. As the hero walks down the street, we see snippets of easter eggs before he turns the corner into the PlayStation world, that collides with our world, creating a crater where a dragon, F22 Raptors, spaceships, Corvettes, and a host of other cool things in frame come to life.
    
    Don't deny yourself the glory, fame and power you so richly deserve. Don't settle for less when you can get more. Don't settle for anything less than greatness. Don't settle for anything less than PlayStation.
